BURST-CORE
by f1lt3r @ Bocoup

This is a quick first pass at re-writing the animation core of The Burst Engine for generic JS Object timeline control.

This version is designed to be used with anything!! WebGL Objects, Processing JS Game Characters, DOM Objects, SVG Objects and even Audio Signals.

Developers will probably be used to various animation functions across a variety of libraries. The Burst Engine takes animation control one step further with Timeline > Object > Property-Track > KeyFrame animation, suitable for comlpex, multi-layered, non-linear animations.
